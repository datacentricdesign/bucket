**[Bucket](https://dwd.tudelft.nl/bucket)** is a cloud application that supports design researchers and practitioners to collect and explore behavioural data with active participation from all stakeholders.

Its concept of **Things** facilitates the prototyping of live data prototypes.

Its concepts of **Apps** facilitate the prototyping of web and mobile data explorers, customised for the appropriate insights and reflections tasks. 

You acquire data through an App from data donation, crowdsourcing or landing pages; you collect data by prototyping an Arduino, Rasberry Pi or custom-based device that you land to participants; or you directly upload data from files. Then, you explore the harvested time series with a generic tool such as Grafana. You can export the data to use it in your prefered data tool at all times. Finally, you customise an App to explore and annotate with participants.

Data is strongly typed to facilitate transfer and automate processing. But you create you can create your types (e.g. data structures) adapted to your need.

Data is locked by default in its Things, only accessible by its owner. You grant and revoke access to your data at your convenience.

Bucket is a cloud application that helps collect and use data for Data-Centric Design processes.
