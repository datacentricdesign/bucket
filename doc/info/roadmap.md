# Roadmap



## Goal

Bucket is a research prototype developed by the Data-Centric Design Lab. It is an object of study to better understand how to support the use of behavioural data as a participatory design material. Thus, Bucket development and use must lead to the collection of insights towards this understanding.

* Behavioural data as a mundane participatory design material.
* Behavioural data as a collaboration agent.
* Behavioural data as a 


## Routes

### Data Donation

Partnership, value gain

### Data Reflection


### Data Mediation


## Design Activities

Diversity of contexts

offering tools to designers and observe how they use them
reflect with designer about limitations, what they would like to get from data

- Data-centric graduation Projects:
- Hackathon: observe how tools are used, what are the intentions and what are the limitations
- Education/classes

## Stakeholders

- designers
- participants
- regulatory bodies


where to, what is to be achieved

Challenges to overcome:

- the balance between effort and benefits
- agency over data
- trust of all stakeholders


Designers are not yet using behavioural data, there are opportunities, but how do they approach it?


Main end-user: designers
Secondary user: participants, regulatory bodies




Route: set of large milestones


The role of community in data-centric participatory design.


ETA: when we must be there


What can go wrong? Risk and mitigation

What we are not going to do?
