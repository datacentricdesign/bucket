## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Bucket Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [lab@datacentricdesign.org](mailto:lab@datacentricdesign.org).

## Getting started

Note: local deployment will only work through 'localhost'; any other domain will fail to authenticate.
It means that you cannot use this deployment for external devices like phone or Arduino.

### Deployment with Docker Compose

To run Bucket locally with docker-compose:

1. Copy development.env in .env
2. Run docker-compose

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can access bucket-ui on [http://localhost:4200/bucket](http://localhost:4200/bucket)
You can access bucket-api on [http://localhost:8081/bucket/api](http://localhost:8081/bucket/api)

To look at the latest logs (tail for online the last x lines, f for listening to incoming logs):

```sh
docker logs bucket-api --tail=1000 -f
docker logs bucket-ui --tail=1000 -f
```
