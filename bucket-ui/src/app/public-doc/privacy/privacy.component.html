            <b>Data-Centric Design Lab</b> &#8212; The Data-Centric Design Lab is a Delft Design Lab structure,
            connecting researchers, students and industry partners with the theme of data in Participatory Design.
            Through its research, the lab members prototype and test open-source digital tools to support the use of
            data in design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Profile</b> &#8212; Profile is a cloud application managing user accounts for the digital tools of the
            Data-Centric Design Lab. It serves the role of Identity Provider for all mobile and web applications relying
            on these tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Person</b> &#8212; A Person represents a physical person as a user of the Data-Centric Design Lab's
            digital tools. They are characterised by a unique username and email address, a name and a password.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bucket</b> &#8212; Bucket is a cloud application to facilitate data manipulation and exploration as part
            of a Design process. It is open-source software written in TypeScript and maintained by the Data-Centric
            Design Lab.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Thing</b> &#8212; A Thing represents a physical or virtual component collecting data. For example, a
            phone which collects acceleration, a website recording number of page views. It is characterised by a
            unique, auto-generated identifier, a name and a type.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Property</b> &#8212; A Property represents a variable element of a Thing, generating a data-trace over
            time. It is composed of dimensions evolving together. For example, a temperature property has one dimension
            of temperature in Celsius degree while an accelerometer property has three dimensions, one for each axis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Property Type</b> &#8212; A Property Type defines the structure of a Property, i.e. the number of
            Dimensions and the characteristics of these Dimensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dimension</b> &#8212; A Dimension characterises a data point, including a name, a type (primitive such as
            string, boolean and number or MIME such as audio/mp3) and a unit (e.g. Km/h or .mp3).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Consent</b> &#8212; A Consent applies to a Property. It is an explicit agreement from a Person owning a
            Thing to allow access to the data of one Property of the owned Thing, to a Person, Thing or Group. This
            consent focuses on access only (no data edition nor property manipulation). This consent can be revoked at
            all times. It concerns the data collected and updates when new data are collected after consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Shared Property</b> &#8212; A shared Property is a property whose data access has been consented to by
            the Person who owns it (by owning the Thing it is part of).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Group</b> &#8212; A group represents a set of Things and Persons. It is owned and managed by a Person.
            All members of a group can access data of the Property shared with this group.
          </li>
