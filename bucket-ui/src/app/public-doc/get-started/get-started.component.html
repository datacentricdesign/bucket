    <h2>Authentication</h2>

    Most Bucket services require authentication via token placed in the `Authorization` header:

    <ul>
      <li>
        A bearer token as a result of an OAuth2 flow. A Person relies on bearer tokens to interact with Bucket. The client (e.g. web or mobile app) must be registered as a DCD hub app.
      </li>
      <li>
        A JWT token based on public/private keys. A Thing relies on JWT tokens to interact with Bucket. The client generates a set of public and private keys and shares the public key with Bucket. It can then generate JWT tokens with the private key to authenticate itself on Bucket.
      </li>
    </ul>
