      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Most Bucket services require authentication via token placed in the `Authorization` header:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A bearer token as a result of an OAuth2 flow. A Person relies on bearer tokens to interact with Bucket. The
            client (e.g. web or mobile app) must be registered as a DCD hub app.
          </li>
          <li>
            A JWT token based on public/private keys. A Thing relies on JWT tokens to interact with Bucket. The client
            generates a set of public and private keys and shares the public key with Bucket. It can then generate JWT
            tokens with the private key to authenticate itself on Bucket.
          </li>
        </ul>
