          On Mac, this tool is already installed. On Windows, you can download and install <a
            href="https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html">openSSL</a>. In the terminal, type in the following
          command to generate a private key. The private key is saved saved in file 'private.pem'. You should keep this
          file
          secret on your computer and never share it.
        </p>

        <code>
          openssl genrsa -out private.pem 4096
        </code>

        <p>
          Then, extract the attached public key with the following command. The public key is saved in the file
          'public.pem'
        </p>

        <code>
          openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem

            Extract sensor streams from GoPro

          A GoPro camera collects much more than the video/audio stream. It also capture data with a wide range of
          sensors.
          This data is embedded into the video/audio stream. Bucket has a Thing type 'GoPro' which facilitates the
          extraction of this sensor data into multiple properties.
        </p>

        <p>
          Go to your Bucket dashboard and create a new Thing, selecting 'Go Pro' as type. Then, each time you record a
          new
          video, go to the page of your GoPro Thing, and scroll down to "Custom Settings for 'GO_PRO'". Select the file
          of
          your video recording (MP4 extension). It will scan the file and try to extract the GPMF, i.e. these sensor
          streams
          stored with the video/audio stream. Finally, it will upload the video as a video property. Once the process is
          complete, you should see a whole new set of property in your Thing, hosting the data of each sensor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that if you upload another video on that thing, it will reuse the same properties and at the data to it.
          This
          might be a desirable behaviour, but double-check the recording time of the video so that both are not
          overlapping,
          thus leading to loosing data from the previous recording.
        </p>

        <p>This is all possible thanks to the great job of the ... developers which we rely on!</p>
