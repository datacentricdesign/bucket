            <b>Data-Centric Design Lab</b> &#8212; The Data-Centric Design Lab is a Delft Design Lab structure,
            connnecting researchers, students and industry partners the theme of data in Participatory Design. Through
            its research, the lab members prototype and test open source digital tools to support the use of data in
            design.

            <b>Profile</b> &#8212; Profile is a cloud application managing user accounts for the digital tools of the
            Data-Centric Design Lab. It serves the role of Identity Provider for all mobile and web application relying
            on these tools.

          <li>
            <b>Person</b> &#8212; A Person represents a physical person as a user of the Data-Centric Design Lab's
            digital tools. They are charactirised by a unique email address, a name and a password.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bucket</b> &#8212; Bucket is a cloud application to facilitate data manipulation and exploration as part
            of a Design process. It is an open-source software writen in TypeScript and maintained by the Data-Centric
            Design Lab.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Thing</b> &#8212; A Thing represents a physical or virtual component collecting data. For example, a
            phone which collects acceleration, a website recording number of page views. It is characterised by a
            unique, auto-generated identifier, a name and a type. A Thing is onwed by a Person and has a list of
            Properties.

            <b>Property</b> &#8212; A Property represents a variable element of a Thing, generating a data trace over
            time. It is composed of dimensions evolving together. For example, a temperature property has one dimension
            of temperature in Celsius degree while an accelerometer property has three dimensions, one for each axis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Property Type</b> &#8212; A Property Type defines the structure of a Property, i.e. the number of
            Dimensions and the characteristics of these Dimensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dimension</b> &#8212; A Dimension characterise a data point, including a name, a type (primitive such as
            string, boolean and number or MIME such as audio/mp3) and a unit (e.g. Km/h or .mp3).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Consent</b> &#8212; A Consent applies to a Property. It is an explicit agreement from a Person owning a
            Thing to allow access to the data of one Property of the owned Thing, to a Person, Thing or Group. This
            concern access only (no data edition nor property manipulation). This consent can be revoked at all time. It
            concern the data collected and updates when new data are collected after consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Shared Property</b> &#8212; A shared Property is a property which data access has been consented by the
            Person who owns it (by owning the Thing it is part of).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Group</b> &#8212; A group represent a set of Things, Persons and Groups
